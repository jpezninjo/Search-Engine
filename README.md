# Search-Engine

Created the front and back end of a custom internet search engine capable of recursively parsing websites (and text files), detecting nested valid links, storing a mapping of word entries to file locations in an inverted index, then used a ranking algorithm to rank and compute relevant pages in a search results page.

TODO: 
Clean up code and make web parsing more efficient. 
Design a real front-end. 
Implement MySQL database for user login + favoriting. 
 
Make this readme more professional sounding and stuff.
